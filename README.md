Each assignment’s root directory contains the following files and folders:
    * cs236781: Python package containing course utilities and helper functions. You do not need to edit anything here.
    * hwN where N is the assignment number: Python package containing the assignment code. All your solutions will be implemented here, including answers to questions.
    * PartN_XYZ.ipynb where N is a number and XYZ is some name: A set of jupyter notebooks that contain the instructions that will guide you through the assignment. You do not need to edit these. However, you should write your name(s) at the beginning of Part0.
    * main.py: A script providing some utilities via a CLI. You’ll run it to create your submission after completing the assignment.
    * environment.yml: A file for conda, specifying the third-party packages it should install into the virtual environment it creates. Note that every assignment could define a different environment.
